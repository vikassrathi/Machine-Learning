Supervised Learning:

In supervised learning, the model is trained using labelled data, where each input is associated with the correct output (label). 
The process involves feeding the algorithm a set of training examples where the input data is paired with the correct answer. 
The model learns to map inputs to the correct outputs by identifying patterns in the data. Once trained, the model can be tested on new, 
unseen data to predict the output (label) for that input.

For example:

Email spam filtering: The model is trained on emails labelled as either "spam" or "not spam," and it learns to classify new emails based on this training.
Speech recognition: The model is trained on audio data labelled with the corresponding text, allowing it to recognize and transcribe speech in new audio samples.
